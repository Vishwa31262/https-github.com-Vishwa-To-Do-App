# **ZenTask \- A Modern Flask To-Do Web Application**

ZenTask is a production-ready, feature-rich To-Do web application built with Flask and SQLAlchemy on the backend, and a  
stunning, responsive frontend powered by Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.  
It's designed to be a portfolio-worthy project that showcases modern web development practices, including a RESTful API,  
AJAX-driven UI updates, and a premium, SaaS-like design with glassmorphism, dark/light modes, and smooth animations.

## **✨ Features**

* **Full CRUD Operations:** Add, Edit, and Delete tasks effortlessly.  
* **Modern GUI:** Stunning, responsive interface with glassmorphism effects, gradients, and dark/light modes.  
* **AJAX-Powered:** No page reloads\! The UI is updated dynamically via asynchronous API calls.  
* **Task Priorities:** Assign Low, Medium, or High priority to tasks, visualized with color codes.  
* **Complete/Incomplete:** Toggle task status with a custom-styled checkbox and smooth animations.  
* **Real-time Dashboard:** Stats cards show Total, Pending, and Completed tasks, plus a live progress bar.  
* **Powerful Filtering:** Filter tasks by All, Active, or Completed status.  
* **Dynamic Search:** Instantly search tasks by title or description.  
* **Robust Sorting:** Sort tasks by Date (Newest/Oldest), Priority, or Status.  
* **Toast Notifications:** Get instant, non-intrusive feedback for all actions.  
* **Confirmation Modals:** Custom confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions.  
* **Persistent Storage:** All tasks are saved in a robust SQLite database using the SQLAlchemy ORM.  
* **Responsive Design:** Looks and works great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
* **Theme Persistence:** Your dark/light mode preference is saved in localStorage.


## **🛠️ Technology Stack**

* **Backend:**  
  * **Flask:** A lightweight Python web framework.  
  * **Flask-SQLAlchemy:** A Flask extension for easy database management with SQLAlchemy ORM.  
  * **SQLite:** A serverless, self-contained SQL database engine.  
* **Frontend:**  
  * **HTML5:** Semantic markup for structure.  
  * **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid, custom UI design (loaded via CDN).  
  * **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity, DOM manipulation, and API calls (AJAX/Fetch).  
  * **Font Awesome 6:** For clean, modern icons (loaded via CDN).  
  * **Google Fonts (Poppins):** For beautiful typography.

## **🚀 Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### **1\. Prerequisites**

* Python 3.8 or newer  
* pip (Python package installer)  
* virtualenv (recommended)

### **2\. Installation & Setup**

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/AryanPatel03/To-Do-App.git  
   cd flask-todo-app

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**  
   * **macOS/Linux:**  
     python3 \-m venv venv  
     source venv/bin/activate

   * **Windows:**  
     python \-m venv venv  
     .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate

3. **Install the dependencies:**  
   pip install \-r requirements.txt

4. **Run the application:**  
   python app.py

   The application will automatically create the instance/tasks.db file and its tables on the first run.  
5. **Open the app in your browser:** Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://127.0.0.1:5000)

*Note: For this self-contained example, all frontend code (HTML, CSS via Tailwind, and JS) is located in templates/index.html.*

## **🔌 API Endpoints**

The frontend communicates with the Flask backend via a RESTful API.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| GET | / | Renders the main index.html page. |
| GET | /api/tasks | Fetches all tasks. Supports query params: filter, sort, search. |
| POST | /api/tasks | Adds a new task. Expects JSON payload. |
| PUT | /api/task/\<id\> | Updates a task (for editing or toggling complete). Expects JSON payload. |
| DELETE | /api/task/\<id\> | Deletes a single task. |
| DELETE | /api/tasks/clear-completed | Deletes all tasks marked as completed. |

## **🌐 Deployment**

### **Deploying to Render (Recommended)**

1. **Sign up** for a free account at [Render.com](https://render.com/).  
2. **Create a new "Web Service"** and connect your GitHub repository.  
3. **Settings:**  
   * **Environment:** Python 3  
   * **Build Command:** pip install \-r requirements.txt  
   * **Start Command:** gunicorn "app:app" (You'll need to add gunicorn to your requirements.txt file first: pip freeze \> requirements.txt)  
4. Click **"Create Web Service"**. Render will automatically deploy your app.

## **📈 Future Enhancements**

* **User Authentication:** Add user accounts (login/register) so tasks are private.  
* **Due Dates:** Add a calendar picker for setting task due dates.  
* **Drag-and-Drop:** Allow users to reorder tasks by dragging them.  
* **Categories/Tags:** Add tags or project categories to tasks.  
* **Subtasks:** Implement a nested subtask system.  
* **Export:** Allow users to export their tasks to CSV or JSON.
